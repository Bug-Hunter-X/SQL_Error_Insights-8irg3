This repository demonstrates a few uncommon SQL errors that can cause unexpected behavior or errors. The `bug.sql` file contains examples of incorrect SQL queries, while `bugSolution.sql` shows corrected versions.  The errors demonstrated include:

1. Incorrect use of aggregate functions with `GROUP BY` clause.
2. Implicit type conversion issues leading to unexpected results or errors.
3. Incorrect ordering of `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses (in some systems).
