In SQL, a common error is caused by incorrect use of aggregate functions with `GROUP BY` clause.  For example, if you have a table `orders` with columns `customer_id` and `order_total`, and you try to retrieve the total order amount for each customer along with the customer ID using:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, order_total FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;
```

This will give an error because `order_total` is not part of the `GROUP BY` clause or an aggregate function.  It's unclear which `order_total` to select for each customer.  To fix this, you would use an aggregate function like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, etc:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total) AS total_order_amount FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;
```

Another less common, but subtle error can arise from using `ORDER BY` before `GROUP BY`. Some database systems will allow this, while others will throw an error. Generally, `GROUP BY` must come before `ORDER BY`.

Finally, issues with implicit type conversion can lead to unexpected results. If you are comparing data of different types without proper casting, you might get incorrect results or errors.  For example comparing a number string to an actual number.
